# TalkCoffee

### (under development)

## TalkCoffee is a website built using Next.js that stores and displays craft coffee shops. The inspiration comes from Yelp and Google Maps results, however, this website is different in that its sole focus is craft coffee. A solution to finding the best beans and cafes catered to your taste in your area and around the world is what we provide.

Examples of current build:
